# DRM Presentation

What year is it? 2015, already?

Well, I've been fighting DRM - and using this presentation to speak about it - for more than 10 years now. 

There are lots of versions of it, but my plan for this repository is to make the latest version ever available to you.

Notice that, until now, I never did an English version of this presentation, so what you'll see here is in Portuguese. If I ever end up delivering a talk about DRM in English, it is probable that I'll make an English version of this, and I'll have the two variants here by then.

In this repository you will find both the presentation source files (a LaTeX source file and the images used in it), and the result of their compilation (I usually present this as a PDF).

This presentation is licensed as CC0 - use, change, reuse... whatever, at your will.
